# UselessRickroll
This is by far the most useless program I've done, but I'm proud beyond words
## Inspiration
My sister gave me this idea.

## What it does
It asks for your name, and give something in return

## How we built it
this project was built in 45 minutes, no regrets. Not robust as well. It's that useless.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was finish, and it works.

## What we learned
Some people rather choose violence
